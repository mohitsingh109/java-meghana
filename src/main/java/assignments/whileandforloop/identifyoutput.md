```
1. Consider the following code segment:


int n = 10; // n is a given positive integer
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= n; j++) {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
What is the minimum number of times "Hello" will be printed if n = 5?

Options:

A) 5
B) 10
C) 15
D) 20
2. Consider the following code segment:


int k = 5; // k is a positive integer
for (int p = 1; p < k; p++) {
    for (int q = p; q <= k; q++) {
        System.out.println("Hi");
    }
}
What is the minimum number of times "Hi" will be printed if k = 3?

Options:

A) 3
B) 6
C) 5
D) 8
3. Consider the following code segment:


int n = 8; // n is a positive integer
for (int x = 1; x <= n; x *= 2) {
    for (int y = 1; y <= x; y++) {
        System.out.println("");
    }
}
What is the minimum number of times "" will be printed?

Options:

A) 6
B) 8
C) 12
D) 15
4. Consider the following code segment:


int n = 4; // n is a positive integer
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        System.out.println("Goodbye");
    }
}
What is the minimum number of times "Goodbye" will be printed?

Options:

A) 10
B) 3
C) 6
D) 7
5. Consider the following code segment:


int m = 3; // m is a given positive integer
for (int a = 1; a <= m; a++) {
    for (int b = 1; b <= m * 2; b++) {
        System.out.println("Looping");
    }
}
What is the minimum number of times "Looping" will be printed if m = 2?

Options:

A) 6
B) 8
C) 10
D) 12
